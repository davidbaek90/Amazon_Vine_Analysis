## Summary
- Percentage of both paid and unpaid 5-star vine reviewes to total paid/unpaid reviews were both 44%. This shows non bias effect of paid vs non paid Vine reviews. In addition to this analysis, it might be advisable to look at the entire band of the reviews, from 1 star to 5 start to precisely gauge the affect of paid vs non paid members of Amazon Vine program. With this data we can analyze the descriptive statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation and 25/50/75 percentile to show a more detailed pattern between the two groups.
