- The variables that provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg are: 1. vehicle_length with a p-value of 2.60e-12, and 2. ground_clearance with a p-value of 5.21e-08.
- The slope of the linear model should be consiered non-zero, there are three coefficient that contribute to non-zero slope: 1. vehicle_length, 2. ground_clerance, and 3. AWD.
- Since the R-squared value is 0.7149. Which means roughly 71% of the variability of our depends variable is explained using linear model. This model would be relatively effective.
